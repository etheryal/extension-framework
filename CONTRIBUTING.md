## Code of Conduct

At our core, we value the importance of fostering a respectful and inclusive open source community. As a participant and contributor to this project, we kindly request that you abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which outlines the standards of communication and behavior we expect from ourselves and others.

Our commitment to promoting a welcoming and constructive environment extends to all individuals involved in our project. By adhering to these guidelines, you demonstrate your dedication to cultivating a positive and productive community for everyone to benefit from.

## Getting Started

To begin contributing to this repository, please follow our guidelines for submitting Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). Here are a few important pointers that apply to both:

- Our top priority is the security of our project. If you suspect a security vulnerability, please utilize our [Responsible Disclosure Program](https://docs.etheryal.net/security).
- Before creating a new Issue or PR, we encourage you to search for existing ones that address similar concerns.
- While we strive to promptly address all Issues, investigating the root cause may take some time depending on the severity of the problem. If your issue is critical, consider leaving a friendly comment in the thread to catch the attention of the submitter or a contributor.

We appreciate your adherence to these guidelines, which not only ensures a smoother contribution process, but also fosters a sense of collaboration and mutual respect within our community.

### Issues

To streamline our efforts in improving the library, we encourage the use of Issues to report any problems, request new features, or initiate discussions about potential changes before creating a Pull Request (PR). Upon creating a new Issue, a template will be available to assist you in providing us with the necessary information to investigate.

If you come across an existing Issue that relates to the issue you are experiencing, kindly add your own reproduction information to that particular Issue instead of creating a new one. You can also help us identify the gravity of the problem by adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) that signifies that the issue is impacting others as well. We kindly ask you to refrain from adding comments such as `+1` or `me too` as they do not provide any additional information.

By following these guidelines, we can address issues and implement new features more efficiently while minimizing redundant efforts. We value your contribution and appreciate your collaboration in making our library more robust and user-friendly.

### Pull Requests

We always welcome Pull Requests (PRs) to our libraries as they provide a swift way to incorporate fixes or enhancements into our upcoming releases. To ensure that PRs are submitted efficiently and effectively, we request that they:

- Focus on either fixing/adding the functionality in question OR addressing widespread style issues, not both.
- Include unit or integration tests for any altered or added functionality.
- Address a single concern in the least possible number of changed lines.

For changes that involve core functionality or necessitate breaking changes (e.g., a major release), we recommend initiating an Issue to discuss your proposal before proceeding. While this is not mandatory, it can save time during the development and review phases.

In general, we abide by the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow, which comprises the following steps:

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account.
2. Clone the project to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch with a brief but descriptive name.
4. Commit changes to the branch, adhering to any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repository.
5. Push the changes to your fork.
6. Open a PR in our repository and complete the PR template to facilitate the review process.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your contributions are integrated smoothly and effectively into our libraries. We appreciate your collaboration in making our libraries more functional and user-friendly.
