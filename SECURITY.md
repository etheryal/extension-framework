## Reporting a Vulnerability

Our top priority is the security of our project. If you suspect a security vulnerability,
please utilize our [Responsible Disclosure Program](https://docs.etheryal.net/security).

Another option available to you is to report a vulnerability using GitHub. To do so, please follow these steps:

- Go to GitHub.com and access the main page of the repository.
- Look for the "Security" tab located under the repository name. In case you can't see it,
  click on the dropdown menu and select Security.
- Click on "Report a vulnerability" to access the advisory form.
- Fill out all the required fields in the advisory details form accurately and thoroughly.
